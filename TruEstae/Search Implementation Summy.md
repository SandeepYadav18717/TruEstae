In the searching we are using the Merge sort

### **1. Merge Sort is a Stable Sorting Algorithm**

Merge sort maintains the relative order of records with equal keys.
Stability is very important in search systems where records may contain multiple fields. When sorting by one field (e.g., name), records with equal names must remain in the same order based on other attributes (e.g., ID).

Merge sort provides consistent time complexity:

* **Best Case:** O(n log n)
* **Average Case:** O(n log n)
* **Worst Case:** O(n log n)
