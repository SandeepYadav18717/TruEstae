Technologies and Concepts Used in Our Project

1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML is used to create the basic structure of the user interface.
It defines elements such as tables, buttons

2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS is used to style and design our frontend.
It helps in:

Improving UI/UX

Making the application responsive

Adding colors, spacing, animations, and layout control

3. React (Frontend Framework)

React is used for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. We use React because:

It updates the UI instantly without reloading the page

It makes components reusable

It handles large data efficiently

It creates a smooth, fast experience for the user

React is ideal for applications where data changes frequently, such as sorting, searching, or filtering.

4. Python (Backend Programming Language)

Python is used in the backend because it is:

Easy to write and maintain

Powerful for data processing

Highly suitable for working with large datasets, CSV files, and sorting algorithms

Python also supports libraries like Pandas, which help us read, clean, sort, and process data efficiently.

5. FastAPI (Backend Framework)

FastAPI is used to create fast and efficient APIs.
It offers:

High performance

Automatic documentation

Easy integration with frontend

Asynchronous processing for speed

React calls the FastAPI backend to get sorted or processed data.

6. Data Structures (Core Logic Implementation)

Data structures and algorithms are used to implement the sorting and searching mechanisms inside the backend.

For example:

Why Merge Sort?

It gives consistent performance: O(n log n)

Works better with large datasets

Stable sorting algorithm

Used in real search engines and databases

Using data structures improves:

Performance

Accuracy
